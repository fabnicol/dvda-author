Main issues 2019.08
----------------------------------

A serious regression was detected in Nov. 2013 for discs having several titles of different audio
formats, especially 24-bit audio.
Bug tracking revealed that the issue was related to a patch applied proposed by a contributor and
applied in version 09.09, in the wake of multichannel implementation. Versions between the original
2005 code and version 09.05 are unaffected by this regression.
Files affected were: src/audio.c and src/ats.c

Other issues, mostly minor
--------------------------

1. On Windows platforms, and more generally when getsubopt() should be recompiled (with glibc/ sources)
long option --fixwav may not be available in combination with sub-options, depending on compilers.
Usage: Replace --fixwavprune,interactive with -Fprune,interactive.

2. Still under Windows,
   cannot output to D:\ (or partition other than C:) folder if program installed under C:\

4. Menu authoring.
   * Some font sizes (the second parameter in the --font a,b,c switch) may not work for reasons so far unknown. In case of issues,
   change the font size. Issues have been reported with b=20 and b=30, switching to b=18 or b=40 set things right.
   Do not use a background whose dominant color is too close to text color, otherwise text will not be readable and buttons might not be detected.
   * Menus may not be numerous enough for groups >= 5.

5. Bugs may occur with AOBs bigger than 1GB as these cases have not be tested extensively.
6. configure.ac and some autotools file like config.status may be affected by dos line-ending issues when git-importing/exporting
   from a Windows platform. The cure consists in applying dos2unix to m4/, config/ and configure.ac, then recreate configure
   using the autogen script. Other issues may affect m4 files generated by autoreconf under m4 as symlinks. These may be
   created under linux and very effectively foil git-merge.

MLP

TODO: check for 24 bits.
Windows: 
Feature --play is only working under *nix.
--sync: loss of 3 buffers of 1024 bytes each at end of PCM extract, otherwise OK for PCM and MLP. 


Special tracing files
---------------------

As of Oct. 2013, the following files are generated at the root to monitor the toolchain build:
depconf/BUILD.TRACE
depconf/BUILD.TRACE~ (saves prior BUILD.TRACE)
DOWNLOADS
PATCHED.DOWNLOADS
The filenames are self-explanatory. Please check them before reporting a bug.


Hybrid creation
---------------------

Capability currently broken.

1. All lplex-related options to be reviewed as they no longer work: --mirror, --hybridate, --full-hybridate, --mirror-strategy
