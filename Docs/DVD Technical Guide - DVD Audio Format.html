<div class="title">DVD Technical Guide  - DVD Audio Format</div>
<div class="article">
  <strong>1.1 Introduction </strong> <br>
<br>
In February 1999, the DVD Forum formally approved the release of 
DVD-Audio Ver. 1.0, as a new format to handle next-generation audio. 
This was a result of three years of discussion in the DVD Forum's 
Working Group 4, a technical working group comprised of many members of 
the hardware industry, music industry, and computer industry, as well as
 the ISC (International Steering Committee, composed of IFPI, RIAA, and 
RIAJ representatives of the world's music industry). This makes the 
DVD-Audio specification truly a global standard. <br>
<br>
<strong>1.2 Overview of the DVD-Audio Specification </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>DVD-Audio Design Concept </strong><br>
•	Pure Audio: Linear PCM and Packed PCM (lossless encoding)<br>
- extremely high quality (192 and 176.4 kHz sampling frequencies, in stereo)<br>
- multi-channel (scalable, up to six channels) <br>
•	Maintains compatibility with the DVD-Video format <br>
•	Many added features<br>
- still image features<br>
- video features (a subset of the DVD-Video format)<br>
- centralized text, real-time text 
<br>
•	Access features suitable for audio systems<br>
- access units leverage the familiar paradigm of conventional audio 
media album (Volume), group (Title Group), track (song), index (Cell)<br>
- continuation of the basic concepts behind DVD-Video<br>
- TOC-style access method (two-channel content) 
<br>
<br>
<strong>1.2.1 DVD-Audio and DVD-Video formats </strong><br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_1.gif"></div>
The DVD-Audio specification was established as the second ROM 
application format for the DVD family. In formulating the design 
concept, compatibility with the DVD-Video specification was given high 
priority, in addition to striving to meet the needs of next-generation 
audio discs. To this end, the physical format and file format were made 
common with the DVD-Video standard, but this is not all; the DVD-Audio 
specification also aims to share much in common with DVD-Video in its 
application format. The specification for audio data, the core of 
playback data for DVD-Audio, is comprised of portions compliant to the 
DVD-Video specification, portions which are extensions of the DVD-Video 
specification, and portions which were newly defined for DVD-Audio. The 
specifications for compressed audio and video are a subset of the 
DVD-Video specification &amp; complying with that specification but with
 some additional restrictions added &amp; thus maintaining complete data
 compatibility. Some portions of the specification for still images, 
menus, and text data follow the DVD-Video specification, but most 
portions are newly defined to provide more appropriate features for 
audio discs. <br>
<br>
<strong>1.2.2 Discs and players </strong><br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_2.gif"></div>
With the emergence of the DVD-Audio specification, it is anticipated 
that the DVD-Video players on the market will be joined by Audio-only 
players, which focus on providing the best possible sound quality; 
compatible players, which can play both DVD-Audio and DVD-Video discs; 
and many other specialized players to meet users' needs, such as 
portable players and car audio devices. The DVD-Audio specification 
provides the capability for discs to include not only pure audio content
 but also video or still image content which can be played along with 
the audio content. The specification allows the audio portion of such 
video content to be played on Audio-only players, while the video can 
also be reproduced by pre-existing DVD-Video players.<br>
<br>
<strong>1.3 Audio Specification </strong><br>
<br>
•  Major Features <br>
<br>
•	Super Hi-Fi stereo audio <br>
•	Scalable multi-channel capability <br>
•	Downmix control features <br>
•	Multi-channel to two-channel conversion <br>
•	Bit shift capability <br>
•	Audio selection features <br>
•	Attributes modifiable on a per-track (song) basis 
<br>
<br>
<strong>1.3.1 Super Hi-Fi stereo audio </strong><br>
<br>
As a result of discussions with the music industry, the highest priority
 in the development of the DVD-Audio specification was given to the 
ability to perfectly reproduce the musical characteristics desired by 
music creators. That is, the producers of music strongly requested the 
features of complete transparency (that is, the playback sound quality 
is the same as the production sound quality), complete compatibility 
with the signal processing, editing, etc. capabilities of current and 
future studio equipment, and the ability to record past musical assets. 
As a result, linear PCM was chosen as the encoding scheme for the core 
audio content. Linear PCM is also used in DVD-Video, but as DVD-Audio 
gives even more weight to audio quality, the capabilities of DVD-Audio 
are considerably expanded to provide a 96 kHz bandwidth and a 144 dB 
dynamic range.<br><br>

<br>
As with DVD-Video, audio data in DVD-Audio is combined with header 
information and management information to form audio packets, which are 
then combined into 2048-byte packs. These packs are multiplexed with 
other packs to form Objects and are recorded to the disc. Two types of 
objects are specified by DVD-Audio. Audio Objects (AOB) are intended for
 use in main audio playback, while Video Objects (VOB) are used for 
playback of images and audio. The encoding methods defined for the two 
kinds of objects are different. The encoding method for VOB follows and 
is identical to the DVD-Video specification, to maintain compatibility 
with that format. The AOB format, however, uses a new Linear PCM 
(Scalable) and Packed PCM to provide higher audio quality.<br>
<br>
In order to satisfy various requests from the music industry, the audio 
specifications for Audio Objects are based on the DVD-Video 
specification, with extensions to provide further capabilities.<br>
<br>
Sampling rates that are multiples of 44.1 kHz were added to allow the 
recording of currently-existing music assets with perfect transparency 
and no processing required. Sampling rates of 196 kHz and 176.4 kHz were
 added to meet the ultra-high bandwidth demands of next-generation audio
 discs. The bit rate was expanded to 9.6 Mbps to support specification 
extensions for multi-channel audio, in addition to providing ultra-high 
bandwidth.<br>
<br>
Lossless compression (Packed PCM) was added as a means to achieve 96 
kHz, 24-bit, 6-channel (13.824 Mbps) recording and a greater than 74 
minute recording length. <br>
<br>
<strong>1.3.3 Data rate and recording time </strong><br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_4.gif"></div><br>
DVD-Audio takes advantage of the large (4.7 GB) capacity and high (10.08
 Mbps) transfer rate of the DVD format to make it possible to record 
extremely high quality audio content and multi-channel audio content 
that just wasn't possible with previous media. On the other hand, 
DVD-Audio also makes it possible to record over 400 minutes of 
CD-quality audio. The use of lossless compression further expands the 
recording time and effective transfer rate (to a maximum of 13.842 Mbps 
before compression). <br>
<br>
<strong>1.3.4 Scalable multi-channel </strong><br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_5.gif"></div><br>
One major benefit provided by the Linear PCM encoding used in the 
DVD-Audio specification is scalability. Even in actual multi-channel 
recording, the surround channel signals, which consist primarily of 
echo, typically have much lower levels than the front channel signals 
and also require less bandwidth. In such cases, it is possible to 
improve efficiency by recording the surround channel signals with lower 
sampling frequencies and quantization bit depths.<br>
In this context, scalability is the concept of grouping the channels 
into multiple channel groups according to various parameters of the 
source data, and then setting the optimal sampling frequency and 
quantization bit depth for each channel group. A channel group is simply
 a set of channels which are encoded with a common sampling frequency 
and bit depth. For example, the front three channels could be encoded at
 96 kHz, 24 bits per sample, while the rear two channels and LFE (Low 
Frequency Effect) channel could be encoded at 48 kHz and 16 bits per 
sample. Or front right and left channels and rear channels could be 
encoded at 96 kHz, 20 bits per sample, while the center and LFE channels
 could be encoded at 48 kHz with 20 bits per sample. The following 
restrictions apply to channel group audio specifications in DVD-Audio. <br><br>
•	There may be at most two channel groups. <br>
•	192 kHz and 176.4 kHz sampling frequencies may not be used in conjunction with scalability. <br>
•	The sampling frequencies must have common factors. <br>
•	The sampling frequency and quantization bit depth for channel group 2 must be less than or equal to those of channel group 1.<br><br>
 
There are 21 allowable configurations of channels assigned to channel 
groups, and the relationship between channels, groups, and speaker 
position is also specified. Even if the sampling frequency and bit depth
 are common to all channels, the channels must be assigned to two 
channel groups if there are three or more channels. 
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_6.gif"></div><br>
Note 1: must include left and right front channels<br>
Note 2: channel group 1 only, two channels max.<br>
Note 3: if the sampling frequency differs between the channel groups, 
sample timing must be synchronized to the timing of the lower-frequency 
channel.<br>
<br>
For LPCM audio sources.<br>
Two groups max. (  9.6 Mbps)<br>
Sampling frequency, quantization bit depth of channel group 1  Sampling frequency, quantization bit depth of channel group 2
May be changed on a per-track (song) basis<br>

<br>
<br>
<strong>5.3.5 Downmixing </strong>  <br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_8.gif"></div><br>
In addition to conventional stereo playback, DVD-Audio also supports 
multi-channel audio to provide new kinds of sound stages. These new 
sound stages, wherein each channel provides audio quality which far 
surpasses that of CD audio, should make music a more powerful experience
 for the listener than ever before possible. Practically speaking, 
however, all users may not have an environment which allows them to 
reproduce multi-channel sound. Further, there will be different kinds of
 listening environments, such as listening outdoors. For these reasons, 
the DVD-Audio specification was designed to provide robust support for 
both multi-channel audio and two-channel stereo, and thus provides for 
various ways to reproduce multi-channel content in two-channel 
environments.<br>
<br>
One of these methods is called downmixing. Each disc which contains 
multi-channel audio content can have recorded on the disc the 
relationship between the various channels and the left and right 
channels (Lmix and Rmix) of a mixed-down two-channel audio stream. When 
such content is played, the player performs the downmix processing 
according to the following formulas. <br>
<br>
Lmix =  0Lf   1Rf   2C   3Ls   4Rs   5LFE
Rmix =  0Lf   1Rf   2C   3Ls   4Rs   5LFE
( indicates phase ( 180 ) 
<br>
<br>
The downmix coefficients  and  may only be set for Linear PCM data in 
the AOBs, and the values may be different for each track. The 
coefficients may be set in extremely fine steps, with a minimum step 
size of 0.2 dB. This allows the artist to provide audio playback with 
the exactly the desired feel. <br>
<br>
<strong>1.3.6 Bit shifting </strong><br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_9.gif"></div><br>
<br>
When the quantization bit depths of the channel groups are different in a
 multi-channel audio stream the player treats both digital full scale 
values as the same signal level. As a result, when reproducing the 
multi-channel audio the channels with less bit depth will have 
quantization noise that is relatively greater, and thus has a larger 
influence on the total dynamic range. The DVD-Audio specification 
incorporates a method called bit shifting to reduce this influence.<br>
<br>
For instance, if the peak signal level for channel group 2 is less than 
-12 dB, the upper three bits will always have the same value as the MSB.
 This means that the signal can be shifted upward by two bits, which 
allows 18 bits of data to maintain the original 20 bits of precision. 
After channel group 2 signals are shifted upward, data for channel group
 1 is recorded to the disc at 20 bits per sample, while the lower four 
bits of the channel group 2 signals are truncated and the signals are 
recorded at 16 bits per sample. At the same time, information indicating
 that channel group 2 has been recorded with a two-bit upshift is also 
recorded to the disc. During playback, the channel group 2 signals will 
be downshifted by two bits. That is, the MSB of the 16-bit data is 
expanded to add two high-order bits that are the same as the MSB, while 
two bits of zeros are added to the low-order end of the samples, 
producing 20-bit data for playback. This allows the precision of an 
18-bit sample to be preserved, thereby increasing the dynamic range by 
12 dB over what would be obtained by simply truncating the channel group
 2 signals to 16-bit samples, and thus reducing the overall noise level.
 This bit shifting is done to increase the efficiency of sample usage 
and expand the dynamic range of Linear PCM multi-channel audio. It 
cannot be used with Packed PCM, and may only be applied to Linear PCM 
channel group 2 signals. Samples may be shifted by one to four bits, and
 the shift amount may be changed on a per-track basis. Bit shifting may 
not be used when both channel groups are using the same quantization bit
 depth. In combination with the scalability features, bit shifting 
provides efficient data transfer while maintaining maximum bit 
resolution for channel group 2 signals.<br>
<br>
<strong>1.3.7 Audio Selection</strong> <br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_10.gif"></div><br>
<strong>Audio selection playback example</strong> <br>
Note:<br>
AVTT = Audio Video Title (an audio title recorded in Video Format)<br>
AOTT = Audio Only Title (an audio title recorded in the new Audio Format; LPCM, Packed PCM)<br>
<br>
The DVD-Audio specification defines a feature called Audio Selection 
which allows support for audio data in two different formats in the same
 track. The user first sets up his system according to the playback 
capabilities of his player and playback system, and the player can then 
automatically select the correct audio data to play back between the two
 formats. The user may also specify the data to be played back, at 
playback time. Audio Selection is applicable to the following 
combinations of the two types of data (objects or streams). <br>
•	A combination of different numbers of channels (stereo, multi-channel) <br>
•	A combination of different encoding methods <br>
•	A combination of different numbers of channels and different encoding methods <br><br>
<strong>1.4 Additional Information </strong><br>
<br>
The DVD-Audio specification allows reproduction of a wide variety of 
audio content, from Super Hi-Fi stereo to multi-channel audio (5.1ch), 
which provides a powerful concert hall experience. But that's not all. 
DVD-Audio also defines various types of additional information which 
expands the world of audio entertainment, making it a specification 
truly worthy of the "next-generation audio disc" appellation. In 
consultation with content creators, the details of this additional 
information were refined again and again throughout the process of 
defining the format, as the specification evolved to its current form.
DVD-Audio defines three main types of additional information: 1) still 
image information; 2) video information; and 3) text information.<br>
<br>
<strong>1.4.1 Still image information </strong><br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_11.gif"></div><br>
<br>
Still images, as the term is used in the purview of DVD-Audio, is the 
feature which allows still images to be recorded to a DVD-Audio disc, 
and then displayed as images on a display of some kind while the audio 
is being played back, according to control provided by navigation data. 
When playing audio content which has associated still images, a data 
structure called an ASVU (Audio Still Video Unit), which contains the 
data for multiple still images, is first read from the disc and stored 
in buffer memory. After this is done, the audio data begins to play. As 
long as playback remains within the ASVU range (the range of content 
covered by the one ASVU in the buffer), the system can guarantee 
continuity of audio reproduction with no skips in the audio stream. That
 is, there is no need to stop the audio in order to read images from the
 disc. The specification defines several different playback modes which 
expand the possibilities for using still images.
Various playback modes are defined for still image reproduction, 
including display timing, display order, and a variety of visual 
effects. The content creator can select these modes to provide the user 
with the most effective possible presentation of the content.
The following playback modes are defined by the specification. 
<br>
<br>
(1) Display timing<br>
a.	Slide show mode (still images are displayed one after the other, with
 timing defined by the content creator, as the audio is played) <br>
b.	Browsable mode (still image display is independent from the audio 
playback, and the user can control the timing of still image display) <br>
(2) Display order<br>
a.	Sequential mode (still images are displayed in an order determined by the content creator) <br>
b.	Random / shuffle mode (still images are displayed in an arbitrary order) <br>
(3) Visual effects (optional) <br>
a.	Cut in / out <br>
b.	Fade in / out <br>
c.	Dissolve <br>
d.	Wipe <br><br>
<strong>1.4.1.1 Sequential slide show </strong><br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_12.gif"></div><br>
<br>
This example illustrates a sequential slide show, which is a combination
 of sequential mode and slide show mode. In this mode, the still images 
are displayed in an order and timing to fit perfectly with the audio 
content, as determined by the content creator. While listening to the 
audio, the user can also view the images, which are matched to the 
audio, on a monitor. <br>
<br>
<strong>1.4.1.2 Sequential browsable </strong><br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_13.gif"></div><br>
This example illustrates sequential browsable mode, which is a 
combination of sequential mode and browsable mode. In this mode, the 
display order of the still images is determined by the content creator. 
The time at which the images are displayed is completely up to the user,
 who can move through the images like turning the pages of a book, 
moving at his own pace. In this example the basic order and timing are 
determined by the content creator, and if the user does nothing the 
images will be displayed in the predetermined order, and the display 
will move to the next image after a set amount of time passes. However, 
the user can specify "return to previous" or "go to next" at any time, 
and the previous or next image will be displayed in response. <br>
<br>
<strong>1.5 Text Information </strong><br>
<br>
Optional for discs, optional for players <br><br>
 •  <strong>Two types of text information</strong> <br>
 •  <strong>Centralized recording: static text information </strong>
•	When text information is recorded, it must include album name, group name, and track names <br>
•	Other information, such as released date, artist names, etc., may also be recorded <br>
•	Allows easy content search, jacket-like text menu <br>
•	No limitation on language units <br>
•  <strong>Real-time: dynamic text information </strong><br>
•	Recorded in the audio data recording region <br>
•	Displayed simultaneously with audio playback; smallest display granularity is one second <br>
•	Useful primarily for display of lyrics, liner notes <br>
•	Up to eight languages, defined when concentrated data is written, and limited to languages contained therein <br>
•  Character set code <br>
•	ISO8859-1 (Roman alphabet), Music Shift JIS (Japanese) <br><br>
<strong>1.6 Access system similar to conventional audio discs</strong> <br>
<br>
<div class="img_center"><img src="DVD%20Technical%20Guide%20-%20DVD%20Audio%20Format_fichiers/dvd_info_5_14.gif"></div><br>
The DVD-Audio specification defines a hierarchical structure and units 
of access, with the focus of continuing with the same style of 
operations used with familiar previous audio discs. As in the past, one 
song corresponds to one track. However, since one 12 cm single-layer 
disc holds 4.7 GB and is thus has the capacity to hold multiple CD 
albums, it is possible to record many tracks on a single DVD. To improve
 accessability, the DVD-Audio specification combines multiple tracks 
which should be played sequentially into a newly-defined access unit 
called a Group. A Group is a logical unit, and can form a large 
structure of one or more sequential Audio Titles (ATT) as a single 
playback unit. This logical unit can be played continuously with a 
single operation.<br>
<br>
Audio Title is a logical structure which is equivalent to a Title in 
DVD-Video, and is comprised of the presentation data to be played and 
the navigation data which determine the playback sequence. Unlike its 
DVD-Video counterpart, Audio Title is a unit of access that the user 
will not be concerned with. DVD-Audio does not allow complex playback 
sequences. However, adopting the Audio Title and Group as logical 
structures allows the construction of large works containing multiple 
units of content with differing parameters, such as different encoding 
methods (Linear PCM or Packed PCM), sampling frequencies, bit depths, 
multi-channel configurations, with or without video data, etc. Up to 
nine Groups can be contained within a Volume, and up to 99 ATTs can be 
contained within each Group. However, the maximum number of ATTs per 
disc Volume is also limited to 99.<br>
<br>
Group and Track numbers are the units accessible by users from their 
DVD-Audio players. Further, a smaller, optional access unit called an 
Index is also defined. An Index is a playback unit which may be 
comprised of one or more cells. The Index was defined primarily to 
specify numbers of logical units within a track. Index numbers start 
from 1 within each Track.<br>
