dvda-author 16.08 (Aug 2016)
=====================


Installation Instructions
*************************

Overview
--------
To build the application from source code, you will need all the dependencies
listed in the file DEPENDENCIES, depending on your platform. Please read this file before
proceeding.

In short, a full build of main application and all dependencies (libraries and executables)
can be obtained with:

	./autogen
	mkdir BUILD
	cd BUILD
	../configure --enable-all-all && sudo make PARALLEL=-jN 

Administrative rights are necessary for cdrtools to install properly in the local installation 
directory at make stage. They are unnecessary if cdrtools is not rebuilt.

Another way to circumvent these cdrtools specifics sis to relaunch with `make -k' afresh after 
a crash at cdrtools build stage.

Then install as usual:
	(sudo/root login) make install

If you experience issues building from a subdirectory (which is a cleaner building method)
you can also try building from the package root. Some path issues may be thus avoided on some 
platforms.

This application uses a patched version of dvdauthor to create menus.
The default video format for dvdauthor is set to PAL. If you are to create menus for an
NTSC (non-PAL compatible) player, it is advised to add the following specification to the
configure command-line:

 ./configure (...command line...) VIDEO_FORMAT=NTSC

You may use PARALLEL=-jN on the make command line with N=2,3 up to 6, depending
on the number of CPU cores available. This will speed up the building process significantly.

All auxiliary tools will be locally installed under the ./local directory.


WARNING
-------

1. Paths

The auxiliary binaries which are built this way should be in your PATH at run time.
If you ,leave them in place, you will have to enter a line like:

export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dvda-author-dev/local/.../bin

with ... either linux/dvda-author-full.build  or win32, depending on your platform,
before configuring the build as above == and == before running dvda-author too (if from another shell).

To avoid repetitive exports, the former step is automatically executed by the `autogen' script.
The latter step has not been made automatic to avoid possible versioning conlicts with system-
installed tools already under /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.

2. GNU tools

To ensure a smooth building process, check that the GNU autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool),
and auxiliary programs curl and patch are installed on your system (*nix or MSYS)
Also check that your version of GNU make is at least 3.82 (preferably 3.99 at least for MSYS).
Please note that on many platforms GNU make version still is 3.81 and that any build attempt
will fail without a prior tool update.

Tracing the downloads and builds
--------------------------------
file DOWNLOADS traces the downloaded packages
files PATCHED.DOWNLOADS traces the patched downloads
file depconf/BUILD.TRACE gives an account of all builds, either successful or failed.

Qt Creator builds
-----------------

A Qt Creator project is given for a linux build. The project uses pre-built library to be found in 
directory build/lib/linux.  

Core builds
-----------
In case of building issues, you may wish to download no dependencies and enable
a very minimal (core) build, without fixwav, FLAC, OggFLAC, SoX support and without
menu authoring features. In this case, just configure with:

	../configure  --enable-core-build

If you wish to download dependencies first and build them later, run:

       ../configure --enable-all-deps

You'll have to reconfigure later using:

       ../configure --enable-all-builds

which just configures building without downloading packages.

An intermediate way out is to download a minimal set of dependencies (FLAC, Ogg and SoX)
and configure them without building. For this, run:

       ../configure --enable-minimal-deps

To build this set of features (fixwav, FLAC, OggFLAC, SoX enabled but without menu support), run:

	../configure --enable-minimal-build

before running `make' and `make install'.

Alternatively, if your prefer to use compiling defines, you may add

    WITHOUT_FLAC WITHOUT_sox WITHOUT_libogg  as symbolic constants either

at configuration stage :

	../configure CPPFLAGS="-DWITHOUT_FLAC ...."

"Simple configuration" with just:

	../configure

will yield the following configuration :

      -> menu authoring enabled, but without automatic download, nor building configuration of
	 dependencies

      -> fixwav capability enabled (impaired wav header automatic detection/correction)

      -> FLAC, libogg and libsox bindings disabled.

      
Missing packages
----------------
Should any given package become unavailable in the source code repositories, you can restart 
the configure script adding:

        --enable-cont
        
to your command line, so that configuration proceeds with missing packages. Note however that a full
build is bound to fail if you do not download and unpack the source code yourself before running make.
Unpacked packages should have directory names as indicated in m4/dependencies.m4, in the second square bracket of 
the macros DVDA_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE_INSTALL. 


GNU Basic Installation
======================

Build system:

For a core build:

 gcc-4.7 and GNU make (version 3.82+) only

For dependencies, prerequisites are :
 autoconf 2.69
 automake 1.13
 libtool-2.26 and higher

Optionally:
 man2html (to build the html help page). Note that the classic perl program
 (still available on Savannah CVS) is  broken. A replacement may be downloaded using
  ./configure --enable-man2html-download

Please update you *nix autotools system as checks for version will fail if your version
of any one of the tools is older than the above.

Users who wish to regenerate the GNU build system should use the autogen script
included in the package.

Directory config contains GNU build system configuration files.
Directory m4 contains m4 macros used to by the main configure.ac script.

A summary of the configuration features is available using ./configure --help
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Under Windows/Cygwin/MSYS
-------------------------

The building/installation procedure unrolls as for Unix platforms as follows.
However, users are advised to build under a buiding tree entirely devoid of
whitespace in file paths. Crashes have arisen repeatedly in such contexts owing
to a libtool port issue. 
At configure stage, please specify ROOTDIR=$PWD and BUILDDIR=$PWD
_____________________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________________

With Apple and Darwin-based systems (e.g Mac)
---------------------------------------------

The building/installation procedure unrolls as for Unix platforms.
However, you may have to use --with-config=.  for a successful build (see below
"Installation directories for auxilliary files")
_____________________________________________________________________________________


KDE/GNOME Platforms
===================

A desktop file will be installed under:

  /usr/share/applications/dvda-author.desktop

thereby providing a menu link to the application in the audio media section.

An icon will be available under /usr/share/pixmaps/dvda-author.png
which should be in the OS VPATH to be visible in the menu.
The link will open an x-terinal with the application help. It will later be used
to launch a graphical interface.

A man page is installed under /usr/local/share/man/man1/dvda-author.1

Check that /usr/local/share/man/man1 is in your PATH for man for otherwise copy
to /usr/share/man/man1

An html version is shipped with this package.

Windows XP building

See file BUILD.Windows


Depedencies
===========

See file DEPENDENCIES


Building dependencies without the GNU build system
--------------------------------------------------

If you do not use the GNU build system (e.g. building with Code::Blocks project),
check that the configuration file dvda-author.conf is in the same directory as the main executable (see INSTALL for
other options).


Building dependencies with GNU autoconf
---------------------------------------

On *nix and *nix-like platforms, dependencies can be rebuilt automatically from source code.
Requested packages will be downloaded, patched if necessary and installed, some of them locally
in the local/ subdirectory created at by the main configure script.

Rebuilding dependencies may be useful in the event of version conflicts between what is requested by dvda-author
source code and what is already installed on your platform.

Please check that you have a functional internet connection before configuring as follows.

To download dependency X, run the following command line in your build directory:

	./configure --enable-X-download
and 	./configure --enable-X-patch       when X needs patching, which is the case for:

	X=flac,dvdauthor,cdrtools,sox

You can always run:

	 ./configure --help

to get a list of possible configuration options.

Packages will be downloaded from a selected mirror repository and patches from the project Sourceforge repository.

You should add --enable-X-build to the configure command line if you are to build the X sub-package (not just download), e.g.

	./configure --enable-flac-download  --enable-sox-patch --enable-flac-build --enable-sox-build

for a configuration with FLAC and SoX dependencies enabled.

More specifically, from the top source directory:

See file BUGS for issues with libiberty and SoX (older versions) building.

- To build and patch dvdauthor (only necessary if you need DVD-Audio menus):

	./configure --enable-dvdauthor-patch  --enable-dvdauthor-build

- To build and patch mkisofs (and original Schily version of cdrecord in addition):

	./configure --enable-cdrtools-patch  --enable-cdrtools-build

- To build and patch mjpegtools (owing to source code bug), if you need to enable menu authoring only:

	./configure --enable-mjpegtools-patch --enable-mjpegtools-build

- To build help2man:

	./configure --enable-help2man-download  --enable-help2man-build

- To build ImageMagick:

	./configure --enable-ImageMagick-download  --enable-ImageMagick-build


- To avoid repreating -build enable options, you may just add to command line:

	--enable-all-builds

  after the -patch and -download options.

If your libFLAC library is installed in a non-standard directory (i.e. not /usr/lib
or /usr/local/lib) you may have to use configure options

	   --with-flac=/full/path/to/libFLAC.a

to help out the linking process. You may equally
indicate the path to libsox using --with-sox=/full/path/to/libsox.a


Compilers and Options
=====================

You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS="-g SHORT_OPTIONS_ONLY"


   You can also use the "--with-debug" options as follows:

- to configure with GCC debugging options, run:

    ./configure --with-debug

- to configure with no GCC debugging options and full O3 optimization, run:

    ./configure --with-debug=no

- to configure with user-specific options, run:

    ./configure --with-debug-flags='your specific options'

You may conditionally compile dvda-author to exclude code associated with some modules,
depending on you requirements. The resulting executable will be smaller, which may or may not
have a positive effect on running times, depending on modules and hardware:

- to compile without the SoX module configure with:

    --without-sox

- to compile with SoX module and build a statically-linked binary, first installed all SoX
  libs on your system and use --disable-sox-shared. Should this fail, try the more restrictive
  option --enable-static-sox, which will look into /usr/lib to find libsox.a and apply tested
  building options on an Ubuntu (09.04) platform.
  When patching and building SoX code with --enable-sox-patch --enable-sox-build, static linking
  is forced to the locally-built library.

- to compile without the fixwav module configure with:

    --without-fixwav

- to compile without FLAC/Ogg FLAC:

    --without-flac

 Alternatively, you may add, repectively:

 #define WITHOUT_sox
 #define WITHOUT_FLAC

 to src/commonvars.h code.

Users who would like to build this package with other tools should at least define
the symbolic constants _GNU_SOURCE and __CB__ at compile time.

Optional Symbolic constants can be defined at compile time to specify some features:

  LONG_OPTIONS for command-line long options (starting with --).
  SHORT_OPTIONS_ONLY to block all such long options.
  LOCALE=locale to recompile for another locale than the default "C".
  SETTINGSFILE=filepath to specify default filepath of the configuration file.
  _LARGEFILE_SOURCE,_LARGE_FILES,_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 enable large file support.
  ALWAYS_INLINE forces code inlining.
  WITHOUT_sox to compile without SoX code
  WITHOUT_FLAC to compile without FLAC/OggFLAC code
  To avoid any (rare) case of console interaction by dvda-author, compile with constant GUI_BEHAVIOR
  

Required compile-time constants:

  _GNU_SOURCE

Default values are configured as follows:

  a) Unless SHORT_OPTIONS_ONLY is defined, LONG_OPTIONS will be enforced by default;
  b) LOCALE="C"
  c) ogg FLAC is enabled
  d) Symbolic constants like _GNU_SOURCE
     are defined by the scripts included in this package
    (top configure.ac file for GNU builds).
  e) Large file support (constants _LARGE_FILES and  _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 are defined)


These constants should be set using the CPPFLAGS variable at configure-time for GNU packages:
Example:

  ./configure "CPPFLAGS=-D_GNU_SOURCE -DLOCALE=fr_FR -DSETTINGSFILE=home/my settings/dvda/dvda.conf"

and with the Code::Blocks, ad the selected constants and values in the Projetc/Build options/#defines tab window.


Build system regeneration
=========================

Run ./autogen from the top package directory instead.


Installation directories for auxilliary files
=============================================

For *nix compatible platforms (including Cygwin and MSYS), if --prefix=directory is not
used as indicated above, the following installation directories are used:

 for binaries: /usr/bin
 for installed libraries: /usr/lib
 for dvda-author.conf and dvd-author.desktop: /usr/share/applications
 for README and HTML help: /usr/share/doc/dvda-author
 for images/icons: /usr/share/pixmaps

Also see fixwav man page and README in fixwav/

If --prefix is used, the above directories are replaced with $prefix/<dir> instead of /usr/<dir>
The KDE/gnome .desktop file is adjusted by configure to integrate a link to the .png image (icon)
in $prefix/pixmaps.

Configure option --with-config='full path to directory containing dvda-author.conf'
makes it possible to change the default path to the directory containing
dvda-author.conf (mainly uselful on non *nix platforms).

See file BUGS for additional advice.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/bin', include files under `/usr/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

You can cause programs to be installed with an extra prefix or suffix
on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

RPM and DEB packages will install under /usr/bin and /usr/include by default.


Specifying the System Type
==========================

There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:

     OS KERNEL-OS

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the machine type.

If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.

Sharing Defaults
================

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Defining Variables
==================

Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).

Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:

     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash

`configure' Invocation
======================

`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.
