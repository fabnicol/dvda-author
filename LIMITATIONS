1. Some newer players do not workout the videolinking scheme  while others do.

2. If using slideshows, some players may have trouble when a track does not have pictures associated to it whilst others do have some.
   Some players will stay with the latest picture displayed on screen in the same case, rather than with a blank screen.
   If you do want to display a blank screen for some track, it may be safer to add a blanck screen picture to --stillpics rather than use ::, ie:

   --stillpics a.jpg,b.jpg:blankscreen.jpg:c.jpg

   rather than the licit: --stillpics a.jpg,b.jpg::c.jpg

3. For top menu authoring, as of version 10.06 build 300, you may use several slides only if there is just one menu.
   Should you need several menus, the number of slides per menu will automatically be reset to 1.
