dvda-author version 20.10 (Oct 2020)
====================================

Quick start
-----------

* Building the toolchain from source:

   ./autogen
   ./configure 
   
with elevated rights under *nix platforms:
   
   (sudo) make && (sudo) make install
   
The patched toolchain source code is inlined in the repository
downloaded with git. If you would like to refresh the toolchain 
using the vanilla packages and applying the patches, you can do
it by configuring as follows:

	./configure --enable-all-all
	
You can also download each toolchain package from Sourceforge:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/dvd-audio/files/dvda-author/Dependencies/

Mind to apply the patches in the patches/ subdirectory of this URL.
	
The building system has been tested under linux, Free-BSD
and Cygwin. For Windows, you can use the codeblocks project to (re)build
the target application once the dependencies have been built using Cygwin. 
Builds with a recent MSYS2 port of gcc and the codeblocks project yield 
better results than with Cygwin.
 
* Running dvda-athor-dev:

See file commandline.txt for usage examples.  See file dvda-author-dev.html 
for usage details.

As this is a local deployment package, add --bindir=local/bin to your
commandline when running dvda-author-dev, if you built the whole toolchain
from source using the configure script.


1. DESCRIPTION
--------------


dvda-author creates high-definition DVD-Audio disc structures from
either WAV, FLAC/Ogg FLAC (version 1.3.0), or SoX-14.4.2-supported
audio formats (.au, .aiff, .gsm, etc.)

This version supports multichannel audio up to 5.1.

It can also create "hybrid" or "universal" DVD-Audio/Video disc
structures, which contain both DVD-Audio and DVD-Video zones.

A navigation feature makes it possible to start playing a video title
from within audio zone or an audio title from within video zone.

Inctructions for use are given in the following files:

  man page: dvda-author-(version).1 html page:

  issues) HOWTO.conf (for configuration files)

3. BUILD ENVIRONMENT
--------------------

A GNU-style make system is shipped with this package.

Details on building issues are given in INSTALL.


4. FILES
--------

Source code directories are notably:

  src main source code files

  libutils Source code for the libc_utils static library

  libats2wav Source code for ats2wav, a DVD-Audio titleset extracter
      that converts .AOB files into .wav audio files.

  libfixwav Source code for a special library that checks and fixes
      .wav file headers

  images NSIS compiler images for Windows installers.

  libiberty GNU libc code for function replacement (alternative to
      -liberty).

  m4, m4.extra, m4.extra.dvdauthor M4 macros, especially:

	dvda.m4 general-purpose macros that could be reused in other
	projects.  auxiliary.m4 shorter general-purpose macros.
	dependencies.m4 dvda-author-specific parameters submitted to other
	M4 macros (using lists).  sox-debug.m4 used to correct a bug in
	SoX code.  iconv.m4, codeset.m4 third-party macros copied here as
	some platforms may not include it and they are used by nested
	configure scripts.

Builds are provided in directory 'build' for win32 and linux.

Important DATA-type files are:

  dvda-author.1 Man(1) page dvda-author.html HTML version of the man
      page dvda-author.desktop KDE/gnome desktop configuration file
      dvda-author.conf configuration file (default command-line
      options) dvda-author.png or .ico images for desktop.
      dvda-author.nsi NSIS script for generating Windows installer.

  BUGS LIMITATIONS HOWTO.conf Help file on how to generate a
  configuration file and use it dvda-author.conf.example Example of a
  complex configuration file project


5. INSTALLATION
---------------

This application performs limited patching of other open source
utilities used for creating audio and video menus (dvdauthor),
analyzing audio content (SoX) or creating a special ISO dic image
(mkisofs).

The special patches used in this process are automatically downloaded
by the autotools configure script.

If you do not use the GNU build system, check that the configuration
file dvda-author.conf is in the same directory as the main executable
(see INSTALL for other options).
