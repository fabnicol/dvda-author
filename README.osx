Directory local.osx is here to shorten build times.
To only build the core application, use ./mcore.sh
after configuring (see INSTALL) instead of `make'.
To rebuild the whole toolchain, use ./m.sh instead
of `make'.
When using the included local.osx directory:
- rename it into local/ (archive the linux local is necessary)
- change PATH to point to local/bin and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH 
  to point to local/lib
