	TROUBLESHOOT ISSUES
	-------------------

Reported cases of troubleshoot often involve one of the following issues, which are not bugs per se 
yet may occur on some platforms owing to configuration inadequacies:

1. Reporting that it is impossible to open a dvda-author.conf (configuration) file
   
   These issues should be avoided by allowing dvda-author to skip the .conf file parsing stage.
   This beaviour is enabled by adding option -W to command line.

   If however you have long command lines and wish to take advantage of the capability of parsing
   config files to store recurring command line data, please read what follows.

   Normally this issue arises when dvda-author is locally run like this:

     ./dvda-author-(version)

   in its own directory, when no dvda-author.conf file is present in the same directory.

   Normally .conf files are installed :
    * under unix platforms in ${prefix}/share/applications/dvda-author-(version)
    * at the source package root otherwise
   
   You can change the install menu for .conf files by indicating them after --with-config 
   at configuration stage (see file INSTALL and HOWTO.conf)

   As a rule of thumb, dvda-author should be run with full paths starting from a node containing both the
   install directory  of the .conf file and the main executable. This is the case when you condigure with e.g.

   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

   and run /usr/local/bin/dvda-author-(version)

   as the .conf file will be in /usr/local/share/applications/dvda-author-(version)
   Simlilarly, if you configure with:

   ./configure --prefix=/home/xxx/local

   cd to /home/xxx/local/bin and run:

   ./dvda-author-(version)

   a runtime error will be reported. You need to run a full path, or at least, from your /home/xxx:

   local/bin/dvda-author-(version)

   In this case, the .conf file is accessible, being located under a subdirectory of local/.

   Should this fail, try one of the following actions:

          a) Manually install dvda-author.conf (found in root package) or any blank file so named
             under /usr/share/applications/dvda-author-(version)  if this directory exists [*nix platforms]
          b) Look at your Makefile in top package and locate the value for 'sysconfdir'. Perform step a) again
             if sysconfdir is not the same directory as the one mentioned in a)
          c) Reconfigure using --with-config='path to directory containing file dvda-author.conf'
          d) Install dvda-author in a directory for which you have access rights
          e) If all this fails, as a last-ditch way out, insert: 
           
           #define SETTINGSFILE  "path/to/your/dvda-author.conf file" in commonvars.h (around line 90)
           and manually change the value of 'sysconfdir' accordingly in the top Makefile.

   
2. Reporting that it is impossible to create menus:

   Try to relaunch using --workdir="path to a directory containing the 'menu' subdirectory of the 
   source code package" (not necessarily the source code package if you copied the menu subdirectory elsewhere).

   Check that you have all the auxiliary binaries listed in the file DEPENDENCIES of the source code package
   and that these binaries can be accessed by the system (they are located in your PATH environment variable).
   Otherwise use --bindir='path to auxiliary executables' (mplex, mkisofs,lplex etc.)
