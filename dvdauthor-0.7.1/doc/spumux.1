.PP
Here's a sample configuration file:

.nf
<subpictures>
   <stream>
      <spu start="\fIstart-time\fR" [ end="\fIend-time\fR" ] [ image="\fIpicture.png\fR" ]
           [ highlight="\fIpicture.png\fR" ] [ select="\fIpicture.png\fR" ]
           [ transparent="\fIcolor-spec\fR" ] [ force="yes" ]
           [ autooutline="infer" [ outlinewidth="\fIwidth\fR" ]
             [ autoorder="rows" | autoorder="columns" ] ]
           [ xoffset="\fIx-coord\fR" yoffset="\fIy-coord\fR" ] >
         <button [ name="\fIname\fR" ] [ x0="\fIx0\fR" ] [ y0="\fIy0\fR" ] [ x1="\fIx1\fR" ]
                 [ y1="\fIy1\fR" ] [ up="\fIname\fR" ] [ down="\fIname\fR" ]
                 [ left="\fIname\fR" ] [ right="\fIname\fR" ] />
         <action [ name="\fIname\fR" ] [ x0="\fIx0\fR" ] [ y0="\fIy0\fR" ] [ x1="\fIx1\fR" ]
                 [ y1="\fIy1\fR" ] />
      </spu>
   </stream>
</subpictures>
.fi
.PP
Each subtitle image is described by an <spu> tag.  The start and
optional end attributes describe when the subtitle will be displayed
on the screen, in "HR:MM:SS.HU".  The image attribute describes the
main subtitle image, which can either be a PNG or BMP file.  If your
image is not a full screen image, you can use xoffset and yoffset to
move the picture around.  In the advent that the author is unable to
use a graphics format with an alpha channel, then the transparent
attribute can be used to describe which color should become fully
transparent.  For the valid formats for \fIcolor-spec\fR,
see SPECIFYING COLORS below.  If you want to
force the display of the subtitle, regardless of whether the user has
enabled subtitles or not, you can use the force tag.  When you are
making menus, the force tag is required.
.PP
The remaining attributes and tags are related to menu creation.  The
highlight attribute shows what all the buttons look like when they are
highlighted (i.e. when you are using the arrows in the menu), and the
select attribute shows what all the buttons look like when the are
selected (i.e. for the 1-2 seconds after you press enter in the menu).
If either of these (or the image attribute) are omitted, then spumux
creates a blank (totally transparent) image.  Obviously at least one
tag should be specified.
.PP
To aid in button creation, the autooutline attribute instructs spumux
to infer where the buttons are located.  It does this by attempting to
draw rectangles around a composition of the highlight and select
images which do not intersect any opaque or semi-opaque pixels.  In
order to support textual buttons, the attribute outlinewidth allows
you to specify the width of the rectangle which is tested.  Wider
rectangles won't be able to squeeze between the letters.  Finally,
autoorder describes which way to order the automatically detected
buttons, which is important for numerically selected buttons and for
mapping buttons to button names or to the implied names.
.PP
The button and action tags describe the buttons (visibly selectable
objects on the screen) and actions (commands that are executed as soon
as the associated key is pressed on the remote).  If you are using the
autooutline feature, just designing buttons, are happy with the
inferred button navigation, and can deal with the simplistic naming
system, then you actually do not even need to specify any buttons or
actions.  Otherwise, read on.
.PP
The name attribute is used to give a button or action an easy to refer
to name.  By default they are numbered sequentially starting with "1".
The up, down, left, and right names describe which button or action
should be tied to the corresponding key when the current button is
highlighted, though if omitted spumux will use a reasonably
intelligent algorithm to determine which buttons to move to.
.PP
The (x0,y0) coordinates describe the upper left hand corner
inclusively, while the (x1,y1) coordinates describe the lower right
hand corner EXclusively.  The coordinates start at 0,0 for the upper
left hand corner.  Ideally, the y0 and y1 coordinates should both be
even, so the button edges fully empasses two interlaced scanlines,
even if there is no data in the extra scanline.  Some DVD players will
fill in the extra scanline if it is not specified; spumux makes an
effort to ensure that will be transparent but there is no guarantee.
.SH "HANDLING TEXT-BASED SUBTITLES"
.PP
Spumux is also able to handle text subtitles, which will be rendered to
graphics by spumux. A lot of different text (must be non-graphic) formats 
are supported (.sub, .srt, .ssa, .smi, .rt , .txt, .aqt, .jss, .js, ass).
Spumux will try to determine the format automatically. 
.PP
If processing text-based subtitles no other streams can be defined, buttons 
or others need to be processed in another pass with spumux, using another 
xml file.
.PP
Following .xml file shows the available tags and their default settings. 
Only the textsub tag is mandatory, defaults are used if the specific tag 
is not specified.

.nf
<subpictures [format="NTSC|PAL"]>
   <stream>
      <textsub filename="demo1.srt" characterset="UTF-8"
         fontsize="28.0" font="arial" fill-color="\fIcolor-spec\fR"
         outline-color="\fIcolor-spec\fR" outline-thickness="3.0"
         shadow-offset="0, 0" shadow-color="\fIcolor-spec\fR"
         horizontal-alignment="left"  vertical-alignment="bottom"
         left-margin="60" right-margin="60"
         top-margin="20" bottom-margin="30" subtitle-fps="\fIfps\fR"
         movie-fps="\fIfps\fR"
         movie-width="720" movie-height="\fIheight\fR" aspect="4:3"
         force="yes"
      />
   </stream>
</subpictures>
.fi
.PP
The textsub tag defines the settings for the text to graphics rendering. 
.PP
The filename attribute defines the path and name of the input text subtitle 
file, this is the only attribute that is mandatory.
.PP
The characterset attribute defines the characterset to be used, available 
charactersets can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv.
.PP
The fontsize attribute defines the size of the font in font units.
The font attribute defines the font used. Spumux will match the font name
using Fontconfig if available, else it will use it as a filename on linux
systems and will look into the windows/fonts and subdirectory spumux of
the cygwin/mingw home directory and into the execution directory for windows-based 
execution for the specified font. Looking for free fonts? One listing is 
here http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/links.asp?type=free&part=1 
(this is only about fonts, not about operating systems).
.PP
The fill-color attribute specifies the color to be used for filling the interior
of the text, while outline-color specifies the color for the outline border to draw
around each character, to set it off from the video background.
The outline-thickness attribute specifies the thickness of this outline. For the
valid formats for \fIcolor-spec\fR, see SPECIFYING COLORS below.
The default fill color is white and the default outline color is black.
.PP
The shadow-offset and shadow-color attributes specify a shadow effect to be applied
to the text. The shadow-offset is specified as 2 signed integers, being the horizontal and
vertical offset respectively, with positive values being to the right and down. For the
valid formats for \fIcolor-spec\fR, see SPECIFYING COLORS below.
The default shadow color is black.
.PP
The horizontal-alignment attribute defines the horizontal alignment of the 
subtitles. Options are: "left", "right", "center" and "default".
The "default" value causes spumux to use the attribute that is in the text 
subtitle file if the format supports such an attribute.
.PP
The vertical-alignment attribute defines the vertical alignment.
Options are: "top", "center" and "bottom".
.PP
The margin attributes define the minimum blank pixel space between the 
border of the image and the border of the subtitle lines.
.PP
The subtitle-fps is needed for subtitle formats which use frame numbers rather
than fractional seconds for specifying subtitle times, while the movie-fps
is the frame rate of the movie onto which the subtitles are being multiplexed; if
omitted, both of these default to 29.97 for NTSC and 25 for PAL.
.PP
Having separate subtitle-fps and movie-fps attributes make it possible for 
spumux to recalculate the subtitle timing if these are not the same.
.PP
The movie-width and movie-height attributes define the maximum size of 
the subtitle page, these shouldn't be larger than the size of the 
video frame (720x480 for NTSC, 720x576 for PAL), normally they are the same.
Some DVD players prefer subtitle frames that are 2 or 4 pixels smaller in height.
If omitted, the default movie width is 720 and the height is 2 pixels less than
the video frame height.
.PP
The aspect attribute lets you specify whether the video aspect ratio is 16:9 (widescreen)
or 4:3. This, together with the video format, is used to adjust the rendering of the
text to ensure it appears undistorted.
.PP
The force option allows you to force the display of the subtitle,
regardless of whether the user has enabled subtitles or not.
.SH "SPECIFYING COLORS"
.PP
Colors for image transparency and text fill and outlines can be specified in a number
of ways:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
As a color name, e.g. "green". You can use most of the color names
listed at <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/color.php>\&.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
As a hexadecimal string preceded by a "#", similar to HTML format,
e.g. "#FF8080". The number of digits must be a multiple of 3; the first group specifies
the red component, the second green, and the third blue.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
As the name of a color space, followed by one to four component values
in parentheses, e.g. "hsv(120, 50%, 90%)".
.PP
Valid color spaces are "gray" (1 component), "graya"
(2 components), "hsl" (3 components), "hsla" (4 components), "hsv" (3 components),
"hsva" (4 components), "rgb" (3 components) and "rgba" (4 components). Each component can
be specified as either a percentage of the maximum value suffixed by "%", or an absolute
value in the range 0-360 for hues, 0-255 for everything else. For color space names ending
with "a", the last component is the alpha (transparency) value.
.PP
Note that alpha values are meaningless for the "transparent" attribute on the <spu>
tag above.
