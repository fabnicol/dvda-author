.SH "INCLUDE FILES"
Additional material may be included in the generated output with the
.B \-\-include
and
.B \-\-opt\-include
options.  The format is simple:

    [section]
    text

    /pattern/
    text

Blocks of verbatim *roff text are inserted into the output either at
the start of the given
.BI [ section ]
(case insensitive), or after a paragraph matching
.BI / pattern /\fR.

Patterns use the Perl regular expression syntax and may be followed by
the
.IR i ,
.I s
or
.I m
modifiers (see
.BR perlre (1)).

Lines before the first section or pattern which begin with `\-' are
processed as options.  Anything else is silently ignored and may be
used for comments, RCS keywords and the like.

The section output order (for those included) is:

    NAME
    SYNOPSIS
    DESCRIPTION
    OPTIONS
    \fIother\fR
    ENVIRONMENT
    FILES
    EXAMPLES
    AUTHOR
    REPORTING BUGS
    COPYRIGHT
    SEE ALSO

Any
.B [NAME]
or
.B [SYNOPSIS]
sections appearing in the include file will replace what would have
automatically been produced (although you can still override the
former with
.B \-\-name
if required).

Other sections are prepended to the automatically produced output for
the standard sections given above, or included at
.I other
(above) in the order they were encountered in the include file.

Placement of the text within the section may be explicitly requested by using
the syntax
.RI [< section ],
.RI [= section ]
or
.RI [> section ]
to place the additional text before, in place of, or after the default
output respectively.
