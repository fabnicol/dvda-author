   actually compiling the library itself.  This code is part of the GNU C
   Library, but also included in many other GNU distributions.  Compiling
   and linking in this code is a waste when using the GNU C library

   program understand `configure --with-gnu-libc' and omit the object files,
   it is simpler to just do this in the source for each such file.  */
