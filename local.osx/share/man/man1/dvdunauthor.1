.SH NAME
dvdunauthor \- Decodes DVD-Video file structure
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBdvdunauthor\fR [ \fBpath\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdvdunauthor\fR decodes the specified DVD-Video directory structure,
putting into the current directory an XML control file and corresponding MPEG-2
files (with a .vob extension) that \fBdvdauthor\fR can (hopefully)
interpret to recreate the DVD-Video directory structure.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
\fBdvdunauthor\fR path 
.SH "CAVEATS"
.PP
None.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Depends on libdvdread to decode the DVD-Video structure and to report any
errors trying to do so. But libdvdread will sometimes just exit without
reporting any error.
