1. 	Currently the VCD HR Stills muxing stuff assumes *all* HR stills
  	are the same size which is given in the initial vbv_buffer_size...
	This will work with mpeg2enc (which does this) but will fail fail fail
	with other streams.

2.	The VBVbuffer delay code in the MPEG encoder is hopeless broken.  
	It is currently turned off and needs re-implementing from scratch.
	Not urgent though since no decoder ever seems to take any notice of 
	it.  Certainly I never figured out what the damn thing would be useful
	for once your muxer has checked for /ensured video buffer size bounding.

3.	mpeg2enc is currently broken for 422 and 444 video. The problem is that
	the calculations for checking chrominance in the the motion compensation
	search assume 2-pel sub-sampled U and V in X and Y.

4. 	lavplay, lavrec seek problem when you have movies that are longer than
	2:30, they play back well but the slider in glav does not work
	proper when about 2:30 is reached

5.	2.6.38 Kernels don't have v4l(1) any more. So lavrec does not work any
	more. Actually you can't compile lavrec. the configure script detects
	that and disables lavrec if the kernel headers for v4l are not found.
	lavrec should be updated to us v4l2
