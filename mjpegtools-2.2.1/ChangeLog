	* Created intial automake & autoconf files (still lot of bugs, I
	guess ;) )

	* Created libmovtar (read/write support not complete yet)

	* Created libmjpeg

2000-12-07 Andrew Stevens (as@comlab.ox.ac.uk)

	* 1.3b2 release.  Tag: Rel1_3Beta2

	* Initial support for Software-only mjpeg playback.

	* Seperated mpeg encoding tools from tools used to extract raw
	audio/video from mjpeg.

	mpeg2enc. Bugs fixed. Run-time selection of MMX/extended
	MMX/SSE/3D-Now! routines as appropriate.

	* mplex now much faster, debugged, and supports correct VCD
	compatible multiplexing and splitting of streams into multiple files.
	Initial MPEG-2 video support.  Supports layer 3 audio and (hopefully)
	MPEG audio V2 and V2.5 though these don't look too useful...

        * Bug fixes and support for software-only playback of mjpeg.

2001-01-25 Andrew Stevens (as@comlab.ox.ac.uk)

	* More robust audio driver handling (SB-Live now works!).

	* 1.4 release Tag: Rel1_4
	
	* Dynamic GOP sizing and SMP support in mpeg2enc.  Minor refinements to

	* Signficant enhancement and bug-fixing of lavrec and lavtools.

	* Addition of yuvscaler and yuvplay, ypipe and yuv2lav utilities

	* Unified output logging format and consistent command line flags.

	* Lots of bug fixes.

	* Man pages.
	
	* Binary packages.

2001-06-21 Andrew Stevens (as@comlab.ox.ac.uk)
	
        * 1.5 series

        * Splitting mpeg encoder into re-entrant library and front-end(s).

	* Switch to multi-frame ppm

Revision 1.15  2008/11/29 19:31:20  wackston2
Trial fix: stop sampling frames at Q floor (where Actual bits *expected* to be
           < Target bits) to compute mean Target/Actual ratio after pass2
           reencoding.
Tidying:  remove some redundant inclusion of config.h

Revision 1.14  2001/07/08 21:21:15  wackston
Added VBR audio support.
Fixed wav headers so they indicate a long not a short stream
if header is aborted...

Revision 1.13  2001/06/23 14:14:41  wackston
First stage of single-pass muxing.  Video now single-pass.

Revision 1.12  2001/05/26 12:37:50  wackston
Tidying doco for packaging...

Revision 1.11  2001/05/10 19:52:36  wackston
Tidyings and fixing up to the 1.4 release.

Revision 1.10  2001/05/06 15:59:15  wackston
Bug fix for m/c type select in motion.c  also made field M/C use
chroma info.

Minor fixes elewhere related consistenct logging / command lines.

Revision 1.9  2001/02/07 14:45:05  wackston
Minor tidyings and bug-fixes ready for 1.3b3 release.

Revision 1.8  2001/01/25 20:11:29  wackston
Initial SVCD support in mplex. Update TODO files..

Revision 1.7  2000/12/19 14:34:06  wackston
*** empty log message ***

Revision 1.6  2000/12/19 14:29:14  wackston
Tagging for beta2 release.

Revision 1.5  2000/12/15 19:34:09  wackston
MPEG-2 encoding has been restored to working order. Still some doubts about
whether its 100% correct again but as far as I can tell any remaining bugs are just sub-optimality rather than crass errors.

mplex now support MPEG-2 mux-ing *and* layer 3 audio.

Revision 1.4  2000/12/07 19:09:04  wackston
*** empty log message ***

Revision 1.3  2000/12/07 16:44:50  wackston
Still more minor updates to doco files for release.
