 (DONE)
 * yuvycsnoise
 Noise filter specialized for NTSC Y/C separation noise.
 Only Y noise reduced because UV noise should be
 removed when convert to 4:2:0 from 4:2:2.
 ** add method don't use previous frame but compare more pixels
 ** UV noise
 * yuvkineco
 ** insert yuvycsnoise
 ** BUG: when "-N CycleList", permit InputFPSCODE < 4

* yuvycsnoise
** speed up

* yuvkineco
*** W?: replace whole frame by previous
*** Y?: replace top field by previous
** detect cut change
 Use different field compare threshold
 at after cut changed from after new cycle detected.
*** cut changed at bottom field in a frame: deinterlace?
** add options
*** deinterlace (line double)
*** not output yuv for only create cycle list (needed?)
*** field compare threshold [3/2]
*** field compare threshold after cut changed
*** noise level threshold   [7/8]
*** initial noise level	    [5]
** speed up
** gstreamer plugin?

* lavkineco
** only do 2nd try
** replace MJPEG fields without decode/encode
** implement as gstreamer plugin?

* gkineco
 interactive kineco with GUI
** implement as gstreamer plugin?

* wrapper for yuvfilters to be gstreamer filter
